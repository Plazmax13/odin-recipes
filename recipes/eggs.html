        <h2>Ingrediens</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon milk, plant milk, or water</li>

                    <li>Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and add the milk or water.<br> Whisk until smooth and combined, with no streaks of egg white remaining.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the eggs, and let them cook for a few seconds without stirring.<br> Pull a rubber spatula across the bottom of the pan to form large, soft curds of scrambled eggs.</li>
                    <li>Continue cooking over medium-low heat, folding and stirring the eggs every few seconds.<br> Scrape the spatula along the bottom and sides of the pan often to form more curds and to prevent any part of the eggs from drying out.</li>
                    <li>Remove the pan from the heat when the eggs are mostly set, but a little liquid egg remains.<br> Season to taste with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped fresh chives, if desired.</li>
                </ol>
